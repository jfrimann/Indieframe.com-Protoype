## The project
Indieframe is a Newsmedia sharing platform that enables everyone with a camera to upload and sell their photos and videos directly to the Newsmedia such as Newspapers, Television stations, Documentary film makers etc.

Based on a rough UX and a very early design, Indieframe needed me to work on the the frontend for their webapp prototype in collaboration with their backend developer. They wanted it to be Responsive for all platforms.

## Web Technologies
For the project I used Bootstrap 3 as CSS framework to ensure flexibility and robustness.
I used various Javascript plugins for various tasks, such as:
* retinajs - for showing sharp photos on retina displays
* isotope - for laying out elements with masonry
* jasny-Bootstrap - An addon for bootstrap. I used it for the mobile menu
* imagesloaded - to ensure that all images where loaded before layed out
* and others...

## Process Tools
I used Gulp and Node modules to speed up my development process and Git for versioning.
